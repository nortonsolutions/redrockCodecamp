## By working through our curriculum, you can earn RedRock CodeCamp certifications:


#### 1. Responsive Web Design Certification (Terms 1-2):
##### Beginning and Advanced HTML/CSS

Master the fundamentals of web development with HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design principles. Learn to create beautiful, accessible websites that work across all devices.  Starts with a fun series of webpages about cats --

![Cat Finder!](https://redrockcode.com/assets/images/redrockcode_full_cat_photo_finder_interface.jpg)

**Skills you'll master:** `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Flexbox`, `CSS Grid`, `Layout`, `Responsive Design`, `Accessibility`, `Applied Visual Design`, `Development Principles`

**Projects:** Build 8 pages and 5 responsive web projects that demonstrate your mastery of modern web standards.



#### 2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Terms 3-4)
##### Beginning and Advanced JavaScript

Advance your skills with interactive web applications using modern JavaScript and popular frameworks.  Classic patterns and frameworks that will not go out of style!  Keep AI in check with your general know-how.

**Skills you'll master:** `Document Object Model (DOM)`, `Data Structures`, `Debugging in the browser`, `Algorithmic Scripting`, `Object-Oriented Programming`

**Projects:** Eight steps to create your own universe -- "Virtual Life" -- using ES6+ modules in your browser.  Learn the principles and prepare for TypeScript (and other strongly-typed languages) by mastering the timeless cross-language containers and high-level functions (and unique JavaScript ES6 dandies to boot).

[Click here](https://redrockcode.com/educationMaterials/workbenchProjects/review/virtual-life-08-animate-icons-b8359ae015dc9d5d3f60a85a/alternate2/index.html) for a sample student project; keep in mind that this project teaches principles of object-oriented programming, starting with animating objects represented by text characters to keep it easy, then advancing to graphics.



#### 3. Front End Development Certification (Terms 5-6)
##### Beginning and Advanced Web Development

After this track, you can call yourself a real WEB DEVELOPER, because you will have mastered concepts related to the core JavaScript and TypeScript APIs available in the browser.

**Skills you'll master:** `JavaScript ES6+`, `JSON`, `MVC Pattern`, `DOM Manipulation`, `AJAX/Fetch`, `Storage`, `Templates`, `Routing`, `Bootstrap`.

**Projects:** A spin on Stanford's `Personality Quiz` and extensions for Haverbeke's `Platform Game` (2D side scroller with animation, objects, and various types of decisionmaking such as collision-handling, etc.), along with two more enhancements for the Virtual-Life App (continued from terms 3-4).  The continuity of the terms makes the knowledge stick and come to life (no pun intended!).

![Bluesky](https://redrockcode.com/assets/images/redrockcode_bluesky_project_responsive_web_capstone.png)



#### 4. Front End Libraries Certification (Term 7)

Deep dive into jQuery and React development with state and store management with industry-standard tools and practices.  The certification represents approximately 200 hours of coursework in frameworks including jQuery and React and foundational state and store management via Redux and Thunk.

**Projects:** Develop 5 React applications with increasing complexity for state management and routing, etc. -- a Random Quote Machine, Markdown Previewer, Drum Machine (!!!), JavaScript Calculator, and a Pomodoro Clock.  Notice in the following student submission how these initial projects have bumper rails for new learners, thanks to the Mocha test feedback!

Simple implementation of the [Drum Machine!](https://jsbin.redrockcode.com/tim) using early React; nearly finished student sample passing 8/8 Mocha tests:
[JavaScript Calculator](https://jsbin.redrockcode.com/hey), another student sample, very well done with 16/16 Mocha tests passing:



#### 5. Data Visualization Certification (Term 7, part 2)

Learn to transform data into compelling visual stories using cutting-edge visualization libraries.

**Skills you'll master:** `D3.js`, `JSON APIs`, `Data Processing`, `SVG`, `Chart Libraries`

**Projects:** Build 5 data visualization projects that bring datasets to life.  For example, check out the student sample of a ["Chloropleth Map"](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/EZKqza) in D3, from the original FCC collection:



#### 6. APIs and Microservices Certification (Term 8)

Build robust server-side applications and APIs using Node.js and modern database technologies.  Learn the most popular JavaScript backend stack based on Node and Express (MERN, MEAN, and so on).  These are Node applications which cannot be verified easily automatically via the web or Mocha, so we will work with you directly via email or phone.  Loosely based on the legacy "Backend Web Developement Certification".

**Skills you'll master:** `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `MongoDB`, `RESTful APIs`, `Authentication`

**Projects:** Create 5 backend applications with database integration and user authentication, including a Timestamp Microservice, an Exercise Tracker, and a File Metadata Microservice. 



#### 7. Advanced Server-side Development (Term 9)
##### InfoSec, QA/Test, Advanced Node and Express
Apply all your skills in real-world scenarios through client projects and advanced portfolio development.

**Experience you'll gain:** Client communication, project management, deployment, and maintenance of production applications.

**Projects:** Complete five more projects with your client (RRC), and maintain/upgrade existing applications.
