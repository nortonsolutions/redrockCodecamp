## RedRock CodeCamp Specific Customizations

### Branding System
The platform includes a sophisticated multi-tenant branding system defined in `common/config.global.js`:

```javascript
brandingConfigs = {
  'redrockcode.com': {
    businessName: 'Red Rock Code Camp',
    businessAppName: 'RedRockCode Academy',
    brandColor: '#3498db',
    homeUrl: 'https://redrockcode.com'
  },
  'codebasecamp.org': {
    businessName: 'Code Base Camp',
    businessAppName: 'Code Academy Platform', 
    brandColor: '#e74c3c',
    homeUrl: 'https://codebasecamp.org'
  }
}
```

### Certificate System
Custom certificate templates in `server/views/certificate/` generate branded completion certificates for:
- Responsive Web Design Projects (≈300 hours)
- Front End Development Projects (≈350 hours) 
- Front End Libraries Projects (≈200 hours)

### Enhanced Features
- **Multi-domain Support**: Platform serves multiple branded instances
- **Custom Logo System**: Dynamic logo loading based on domain configuration
- **Local Community Focus**: Utah-specific content and networking features

- **Industry Integration**: Features supporting local tech company partnerships

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20.x recommended, though platform has legacy dependencies)
- MongoDB database server
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup & Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nortonsolutions/redrockCodecamp.git
cd redrockCodecamp

# Install dependencies (expect deprecation warnings due to legacy packages)
npm install

# Create environment configuration
cp .env.default .env
# Configure database connection and OAuth keys

# Seed database with curriculum
npm run only-once

# Start development server
npm run develop
```

### Available Scripts
- `npm start` - Production server start
- `npm run develop` - Development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run test` - Run all tests (JS + curriculum)
- `npm run lint` - Code linting and style checking

## Current Challenges & Technical Debt

### Legacy Dependencies
- Many packages are deprecated or have security vulnerabilities (324 identified)
- Node.js version compatibility issues with some dependencies
- Outdated React version (15.6.2 vs current 18.x)
- Webpack 1.x is significantly outdated (current is 5.x)

### Security Concerns
- Multiple high and critical severity npm audit findings
- Legacy authentication patterns
- Outdated crypto and security libraries

### Performance Considerations
- Large bundle sizes due to older build tooling
- Inefficient re-renders from outdated React patterns
- Legacy jQuery dependencies alongside modern React

## Future Upgrade Opportunities

### Immediate Priorities (3-6 months)
1. **Security Updates**: Address critical vulnerabilities through dependency updates
2. **Node.js Modernization**: Upgrade to Node.js LTS with compatible dependencies
3. **Database Migration**: Consider upgrading MongoDB drivers and connection patterns
4. **Authentication Overhaul**: Implement modern OAuth 2.0/OIDC patterns

### Medium-term Enhancements (6-12 months)
1. **React Modernization**: Upgrade to React 18 with hooks and concurrent features
2. **Build System Upgrade**: Migrate to Webpack 5 or Vite for improved performance
3. **API Modernization**: Consider migrating from LoopBack 3 to Express with GraphQL
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced responsive design and PWA capabilities

### Long-term Vision (1-2 years)
1. **Microservices Architecture**: Split monolith into focused services
2. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live coding sessions
3. **AI Integration**: Automated code review and personalized learning paths
4. **Container Deployment**: Docker containerization for scalable deployment
5. **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for improved performance

### Platform Extensions
1. **Video Integration**: Seamless video lesson embedding and tracking
2. **Live Coding Environment**: Browser-based IDE with collaboration features
3. **Assessment Engine**: Automated testing and grading systems
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive learning analytics for instructors
5. **Mobile App Development**: Native mobile companion applications

## Deployment Architecture
